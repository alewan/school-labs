# Labs

These are my implementations from various labs from my time at the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. 

Please do not copy or otherwise use these labs in unauthorized ways. The belongs to its respective authors.
Furthermore, for existing students, using or copying others' work in submissions is typically punishable under the University's Code of Conduct.

There is no commit history from the labs since they were worked on in seperate repositories. While this is not ideal this repo was used instead because the old repositories usually:
- contained personal and/or private information of myself and lab partners
- contained lab documents & specific instructions which I did not create, and as such I do not feel I have the right to publish them as they are not my work

As such, I will usually to provide a brief description of the lab requirements.

Some of these labs were completed with partners, and wherever this is the case attributions will be included.
