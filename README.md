# Labs

## General Description
These are some labs from my time at the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. 

The only intention of this repo is to publish my work to show what was accomplished.
Some of these labs were completed with partners, and wherever this is the case attributions should be included and this is published only with their permission.

Please do not copy or otherwise use these labs in unauthorized ways. The code belongs to its respective authors.
Furthermore, for existing students, using or copying others' work in submissions is typically punishable under the University's Code of Conduct.

## Courses

## Notes
There is no commit history from the labs since they were worked on in seperate repositories. Some helper functions or utilities may also be missing.
While this is not ideal this repo was used instead of the old repositories containing all materials because they usually:
- contained personal and/or private information of myself and lab partners
- contained lab documents & specific instructions which I did not create, and as such I do not feel I have the right to publish them as they are not my work

To that end - if anyone feels that information is improperly included, please feel free to reach out so that I can remove it.
